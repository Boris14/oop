Exceptions: An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. Exception is a response to an exceptional circumstance that arises while a program is running, such as an attempt to divide by zero.
Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another.

Exceptions can be trown from anywhere in the code.
This can be accoplished by using 'throw' keyword.

throw #someClass#

best way is to throw instance of class

For handling exceptions we can use try/catch block:

try{
	//protected code that may throw an exception
} catch(#expectedExceptionType# ex) {
	//some code
}
